== About ==

phpapi is a stand-alone fork of the MediaWiki API designed to be directly usable by
PHP projects in need of an API. It removes the need to reinvent the wheel by writing
basis API code, so you can get right to implementing the actual functionality you
care about. The API is also quite extendable and has been proven to work.

== Status of the API ==

Currently the API is in alpha; do not use for production usage.
