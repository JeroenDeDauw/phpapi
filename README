== Idea ==

Creating an API base written in PHP that can be used out of the box by projects that want
to provide a PHP-based API without reinventing the wheel. I'm quite familiar with the MediaWiki
API, which I think is quite well designed, and can probably be forked pretty easily to a
stand-alone base API not dependent on any other MediaWiki code. This API is possibly the
most used open source PHP-based API there is (as it's on Wikipedia and every other MediaWiki
wiki), and if not, definitely one of the most used ones.
